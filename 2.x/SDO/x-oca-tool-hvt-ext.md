High Value Targets (HVTs)Â are applications, their underlying information
systems, and data for which unauthorized access, use, disclosure,
disruption, modification, or destruction could cause a significant
impact to an organization's ability to perform its mission or conduct
business.

The IoB HVT extension empowers defenders to share detailed information
about software abuse cases, track threat actor patterns more accurately,
and chart attack flows regarding legitimate software as an adversarial
target. This enables threat-informed leaders and cyber risk personnel to
assess and quantify cyber risks associated with targeted software,
allowing for the development of more precise defensive strategies.

High Value Target is an open concept for the community to use. More information about the High Value Target concept is available at [https://www.highvaluetarget.org](https://www.highvaluetarget.org/).

An extension is added to the `tool` object to include High Value Target
information. The key for this extension when used in the extensions
dictionary MUST be
`extension-definition--fb58a27d-32d2-4b8d-9705-e3cfd2d3dcdf`.

### Tool Type Open Vocabulary Additions

Vocab Name `tool-type-ov`

The `tool-type-ov` describes categories of tools that can be used to
perform attacks. The following additional values are added to
tool-type-ov.
